# minimal-marl
Minimal implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms(marl). This repo complements `ma-gym`.

## Installation
```bash 
  pip install ma-gym pytorch
```

## Usage
```bash
python <algo_name>.py # such as `maddpg.py`
```

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! 

Feel free to send a `pull-request` if you
would like to add a new algorithm or further optimize an existing algorithm.
If adding a new algorithm, it will be nice if it could be tested with ma-gym to maintain consistency.

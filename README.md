# minimal-marl
Minimal implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms(marl). This repo complements `ma-gym`.

## Installation
```bash 
  pip install ma-gym pytorch wandb
```

## Usage
```bash
python <algo_name>.py # such as `vdn.py`
```

## Algorithms

- [x] VPN (Value Prediction Network)
- [x] MADDPG (Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! 

Feel free to send a `pull-request` if you would like to add a new algorithm or further optimize an existing algorithm. 
Also, If adding a new algorithm, please start by raising an `issue` and it will be nice if it could be tested with 
`ma-gym` to maintain consistency.
